STEEL RIVER BLUES:
Wherever I go, whatever I do
There'll always be a smile that I knew
Upon the grey
How it lit the sky
As we dreamed our dreams
And let the young days go by
But there'd come a time
We used to say
We'd both have to part
Just to get away
But the reasons were the same for me and you

How the years went by
Too damn fast it seems
As we followed through
Our young and desperate dreams
You know me so well and I know you
And to the world it seems we both got through
But only you and me know
What is really true
The only thing we never got to do
Kick away

You know me so well and I know you
And to the world it seems we both got through
But only you and me know what is really true
The only thing we never got to do was
Kick away
Those steel river blues
