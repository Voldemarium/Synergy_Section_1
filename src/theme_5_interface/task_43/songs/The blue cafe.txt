THE BLUE CAFE
My world is miles of endless roads
That leaves a trail of broken dreams
Where have you been I hear you say
I'll meet you at the Blue Cafe .
This is where the one who knows
Meets the one who does not care
Cards of fate, the older shows
The younger one, who dares to take

Where have you been?
Where are you going to?
I want to know what's new
I want to go with you
What have you seen?
What do you know thatâ€™s new?
Where are you going to?

The cost is great, the price is high
Take all you know, and say goodbye
Your innocence experience
Mean nothing now
'Cause, this is where the one who knows
Meets the one who does not care
Where have you been I hear you say

Where have you been?
Where are you going to?
I want to know what's new
I want to go with you
What have you seen?
What do you know that's new?
Where are you going to?

So meet me down at the Blue Cafe.

Where have you been?
Where are you going to?
I want to know what's new
I want to go with you
What have you seen?
What do you know that's new?
Where are you going to?

Down to blue
I need you at The Blue Cafe,
I need you at The Blu Cafe
At Blue Cafe.
