MISSISSIPPI
Nashville sky, in the morning sun
Somewhere up north, a new life begun
He was drawn to the twister, with a Memphis sound

Oh Mississippi, running through my veins

Jump a train from Chicago, trace it back
With the neck of a bottle, and the groove of the tracks
Spend your life running, that Angels sweet sound

Oh Mississippi, running through my veins
Oh Mississippi, never the same again.
