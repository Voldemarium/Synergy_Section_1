GUITAR_STREET
There's a crazy sense of duty
As he licks between his fingers
Wipes the ketchup from his face and hands
There's a strong determination
That his teachers never witnessed
Never close enough to understand
He's like a bull just bred for fighting
He don't deliver nothing

School report just says he's lazy
His brother says he's crazy

Through the avenues of fashion
To the palaces of dreams

To some guitars are hot-rods
All along the quest for macho
To others a would-be ticket out of town
For Joe a six-string sten gun
In the 'Panto-revolution'
And Stevie's all just strictly sound
He's like a bull just bred for fighting
He don't deliver nothing

School report just says he's lazy
His brother says he's crazy
But anyway take a look 'cos there he goes
Through the avenues of fashion
To the palaces of dreams
All the way down Guitar Street.
