STEEL RIVER BLUES:
Wherever I go, whatever I do
There'll always be a smile that I knew
Upon the grey
How it lit the sky
As we dreamed our dreams
And let the young days go by
But there'd come a time
We used to say
We'd both have to part
Just to get away
But the reasons were the same for me and you

How the years went by
Too damn fast it seems
As we followed through
Our young and desperate dreams
You know me so well and I know you
And to the world it seems we both got through
But only you and me know
What is really true
The only thing we never got to do
Kick away

You know me so well and I know you
And to the world it seems we both got through
But only you and me know what is really true
The only thing we never got to do was
Kick away
Those steel river blues

GUITAR STREET:
There's a crazy sense of duty
As he licks between his fingers
Wipes the ketchup from his face and hands
There's a strong determination
That his teachers never witnessed
Never close enough to understand
He's like a bull just bred for fighting
He don't deliver nothing

School report just says he's lazy
His brother says he's crazy

Through the avenues of fashion
To the palaces of dreams

To some guitars are hot-rods
All along the quest for macho
To others a would-be ticket out of town
For Joe a six-string sten gun
In the 'Panto-revolution'
And Stevie's all just strictly sound
He's like a bull just bred for fighting
He don't deliver nothing

School report just says he's lazy
His brother says he's crazy
But anyway take a look 'cos there he goes
Through the avenues of fashion
To the palaces of dreams
All the way down Guitar Street.

MISSISSIPPI:
Nashville sky, in the morning sun
Somewhere up north, a new life begun
He was drawn to the twister, with a Memphis sound

Oh Mississippi, running through my veins

Jump a train from Chicago, trace it back
With the neck of a bottle, and the groove of the tracks
Spend your life running, that Angels sweet sound

Oh Mississippi, running through my veins
Oh Mississippi, never the same again.

THE BLUE CAFE:
My world is miles of endless roads
That leaves a trail of broken dreams
Where have you been I hear you say
I'll meet you at the Blue Cafe .
This is where the one who knows
Meets the one who does not care
Cards of fate, the older shows
The younger one, who dares to take

Where have you been?
Where are you going to?
I want to know what's new
I want to go with you
What have you seen?
What do you know thatâ€™s new?
Where are you going to?

The cost is great, the price is high
Take all you know, and say goodbye
Your innocence experience
Mean nothing now
'Cause, this is where the one who knows
Meets the one who does not care
Where have you been I hear you say

Where have you been?
Where are you going to?
I want to know what's new
I want to go with you
What have you seen?
What do you know that's new?
Where are you going to?

So meet me down at the Blue Cafe.

Where have you been?
Where are you going to?
I want to know what's new
I want to go with you
What have you seen?
What do you know that's new?
Where are you going to?

Down to blue
I need you at The Blue Cafe,
I need you at The Blu Cafe
At Blue Cafe.
